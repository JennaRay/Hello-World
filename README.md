# Overview

As a software engineer, I want to always be learning new ways to improve my programming skills and expand my knowledge and experience of coding. 

Simple and succinct, this "Hello World" program does one thing, which is display the message "hello world" to the terminal.

Hello World is a classic first program to write when testing out a new language. It requires one to know the basic syntax for that language, as well as how that language is able to display output to the user (a function which surely will come in handy with all projects further down the road). I wrote this program so that I could have a clear starting place as I embark on my journey to become a more skilled, more educated, more accomplished programmer.
